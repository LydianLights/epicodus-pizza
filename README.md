# _Remote Assembly Request Form_

#### _Allows the user to request delivery of particular classes of organic assemblies._

#### By _**Rane Fields**_

## Description

_This application provides a user-driven graphical interface allowing efficient transfer of data used in the remote assemblage of various classes of materials, mostly organic. The completed assemblage is thereafter transported via existing public infrastructure to a requested location in "meatspace" where the user may receive the physical copy._
